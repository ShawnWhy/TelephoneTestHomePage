# TELEPHONE 2025

A message changing forms as it travels across the world  from artist â†’ artist.  This project pulls data from an API and displays it in a web app.  The data is a collection of art work messages that have been sent from one artist to another, and the web app allows users to view and interact with these messages.



## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
